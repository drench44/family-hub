# Changelog

All notable changes to family-hub are recorded here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Every code-changing pull request adds a line under `## [Unreleased]`; a release
rolls that section to a dated version via `python scripts/release.py`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Versioning system: a single `VERSION` source of truth, this changelog, git
  tags, and a `scripts/release.py` bump-roll-tag ceremony.
- Enforced changelog: a CI `changelog-guard` job and a local pre-commit hook
  block a `src/**` change that adds no `[Unreleased]` entry.
- Auto-published GitHub Releases: pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag publishes a Release
  whose notes are that version's changelog section.
- A debug/ops version readout: `GET /api/version` returns `{version, build}`,
  and a quiet `family-hub v<version>` line shows at the foot of the Settings
  overlay. No changelog on the wall — releases live on GitHub.
- README CI / latest-release / license badges.

### Changed
- Static asset cache-busting is unified to the app version (`?v=<version>`), so
  the css/js cache-busts can no longer drift apart or lag a branch.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-08-17

The baseline: the family wall-dashboard as it runs in production.

### Added
- Chores wall with per-person cards, rotations, streaks, and a week strip.
- To-Dos with Now/Soon/Later tiers and a bounded wall digest.
- Calendar (Google + iCloud/CalDAV) with a full-screen overlay.
- Live camera tiles (go2rtc / Wyze bridge) and a full-screen camera grid.
- Weather, climate, and laundry tiles, each fail-soft and demo-shaped.
- A registry-driven Settings surface: every feature and integration toggles off.
- Mobile app-shell reflow with a fixed tab bar, plus a DEMO mode for screenshots.
